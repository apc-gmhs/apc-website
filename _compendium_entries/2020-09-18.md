Hey there guys, its your main man Mr. Andrew Lester and I'm excited
to bring you the first edition of APC's nationally syndicated
**RESOURCE COMPENDIUM**. Today we've put
together a few articles about what this wacky thing we call
"computer science" actually is, what coding means and a fun
little test about how you've interacted with FCCPS' information
technology. This compendium entry is on schoology, but future ones
will be on the official [APC Website](https://apc-gm.com/compendium){: target="_blank"}. 
<br>
<br>
Reminder our first meeting is
next Friday (9/25/20) at 11am. If you don't show up I will be
incredibly disappointed, and perhaps even saddened.  
<br>
Andrew
